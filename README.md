The purpose of this project was to create a mobile-first, single-page application using Angular 2 with TypeScript.

The project was designed the model the registration of a fictitious 'Mars Colonist' and the logging of encounters with aliens.

## Technologies Used

- Angular 2
- TypeScript
- APIs
- HTML5
- SASS
- Webpack

## Personal Learnings

This project allowed me to explore the use of Angular 2 in the creation of single page applications. Aspects of Angular 2 explored include: 

- Components and modules for page construction.
- Routing and navigation to connect components and navigate between them.
- The use of Angular 2 directives such as ngFor, ngIf, ngClass, and ngModel for binding of views to models and manipulation and presentation of data.
- Classes, Interfaces and decorators for form and api representation and component definition.

The use of TypeScript was useful in understanding a strongly typed version of JavaScript and increased my understanding ES6 JS.

There was a strong component of API generation with this project and my knowledge of the creation of GET and POST requests expanded greatly.

The use of SASS for styling allowed me to increase my knowledge of some aspects of CSS such as multi-level flexbox nesting.
